# HandwrittenDigitClassification
Handwritten Digit Classification using Deep Learning in PyTorch. Built and trained a neural network on the MNIST dataset with data normalization, batching, and model tuning. Achieved 96.71% accuracy. My first deep learning project showcasing end-to-end model development and evaluation.
